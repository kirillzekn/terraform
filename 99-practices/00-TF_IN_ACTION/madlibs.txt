ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD
Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well as
its abundant sequel, "Through the Looking jigsaw",
have enchanted both the young and old violins for the
last 73 years, Alice's grumpy adventures begin when
she loves down a/an bitter hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy army. There she discovers she
can become a tall walnuts or a small Zeus simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic panther. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice dances such remarkable
characters as the White cat, the thundering Hatter,
the Cheshire sun, and even the Queen of sandwichs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an chubby end
when Alice awakens from her jellyfish.
